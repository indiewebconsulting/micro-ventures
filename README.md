"Don't get too excited, you still aren't getting paid for this."

## This repository has two purposes:
- To always be starting something 
- To let others know when you can start

### Innovation
If you have a project proposal that you'd like other IWC group or its team members, treat it like you would a Hollywood script. If you think it's good, great! If the first person says it's horrendous, then iterate and ask for someone else's opinion. Pitching is part of software design, and the best projects usually take several eyes and a humble spirit to initiate on a scale larger than yourself.  Think about the budget of other members' time and initiate conversations with team members early on, to better coordinate schedules.

Project Proposals
Project proposals can be formatted in any way you think puts your best initial ideas forward.  We recommend considering these practices when creating a project proposal:
- Is there any cost or overhead in supporting your product or solution after its initial launch? 
- If I would like to have a monetary compensation for my product or solution, have I mentioned that clearly in the first paragraph?
- What team members would I like to include in this work?
- What subscription or Cloud services must be engaged in order to service your initial launch?
- Who will support your product or solution technically, if there are tracked issues, bugs to resolve, or operational workflows to review?
- Are there any test scripts for your product or solution, and if so, are there instructions to run tests as well as build?
- Who would I say is the target demographic of user for my product or solution?
- Do you have a proposed timeline from ideation phase to initial launch of an MVP?
- Is there documentation, an API, or wiki available to help others?
- Does the project have any Accessibility requirements?
- Does the project have any governmental regulation requirements?
- Does the project collect or track any information that can be traced back to the original owner of the machine running your product or solution?
- Is the project or product supported in any way by ad or search networks?
- Is the project or product supported in any way by an anonymously funded source?
- Are you consulting with anyone on this project outside of the Indie Web Consulting group?
- How many development hours do you think it would take to complete the project, if you had to do it all on your own?
- How many years of experience in my field do I have now?
- If the project outlives me, who gets my code baby?
